        <p>This table shows the official Body Mass Index (BMI) categories used by the World Health Organization. BMI is a widely used general screening tool that helps to determine whether a person's weight is at a healthy level for their height. The range goes from varying degrees of thinness to obesity, with each category relating to a different health risk profile.</p>
      <p>The ranges fall into eight categories, starting from Severe Thinness and proceeding through 2 more classes to Healthy Weight, Overweight, and then three Obesity classes. The ranges are designed to simplify general health screening and are often used in clinical practice, public health research, and fitness testing. </p>
      <p>However, it is not designed for diagnostics due to it's inaccuracy when other health factors must be considered. Especially with an individual's age, muscle mass, bone density.</p>
